# RESTAURANTS DATABASE WITH SQLALCHEMMY

This project shows the customers, restaurants and customer reviews in a database. Customers are listed with both names, the restaurant name and it's price are also shown and the reviews are given in star rating. You are able to add more customers, restaurant and customer reviews in the project. A customer's favourite restaurant can also be seen based on which restaurant they ranked the highest. Restaurant reviews by customers can also be deleted.
